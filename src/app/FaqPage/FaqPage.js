          >
            AMP is a community-owned marketplace and decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain.
            AMP trades are settled directly between the two exchanging parties without any intermediates. We do not 
            hold any funds and have no ability to do so. With AMP, you can trade any ERC20 Ethereum token whether they
            represent native Ethereum tokens or are tethered tokens representing other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies.

            match={match}
          >
            Contrary to most exchanges that take a percentage of each transaction value, AMP trades only cost a fixed amount
            that include the gas fees. The trading is denominated in the quote currency of the traded pair. For example, when trading
            the ETH/USDC pair, each trade will cost 0.5 USDC when completely matched. The current fees for each quote token at the time
            of this writing are 0.5 USDC (for USDC pairs), 0.5 DAI (for DAI pairs) and 0.004 WETH (for WETH pairs).

          >
            Unlike custodial and centralized exchanges, AMP does not hold any funds nor secret keys. You can deposit and withdraw
            your funds immediately and your account can not be compromised by a disgruntled employee or a database hack.

            question="How do I setup an AMP account?"
            match={match}
          >
            Getting started with trading on AMP is easy! If you do not currently have an Ethereum wallet, you 
            can go to amp.exchange and click "Create new wallet" among the suggested options on the login page and 
            we'll walk you through the steps required to create your Ethereum address. 
            <br /><br />
            The current preferred and most secure way to use AMP is to connect with your Metamask account. Click
            the link that will be displayed on amp.exchange/login to install the Metamask browser extension and start trading.
            <br />
            Now that you are connected, you will be redirected to your wallet page. Here is a quick rundown of the basic actions needed
            to start trading:
            <br />
            <FaqList>
              <FaqListItem>• If you do not own any tokens or Ether, you have to make a deposit before any further step.</FaqListItem>
              <FaqListItem>• If you have Ether in your account and want to start trading, you will need to tokenize your ETH into WETH (see next question)</FaqListItem>
              <FaqListItem>• To start trading a token pair, you need to unlock both tokens on the wallet page. Click the switch on the corresponding token row on the wallet page</FaqListItem>

            question="Do i need a pre-existing ethereum wallet to use AMP ?"
            match={match}
          >
            No. You can click the "Create new wallet" option on the login page. However we recommend downloading Metamask for the
            most secure trading experience.

            question="What is WETH and why do i need to use it ?"
            match={match}
          >
            Ether or ETH is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain.
            The native ETH currency does not however implement the very convenient ERC20 token standard.
            WETH brings the ERC20 token standard to ether. When you are converting ETH to WETH, you receive 1 WETH token for each Ether you've converted.
            Using WETH allows decentralized applications such as the AMP decentralized exchanges to offer better functionality and a better user experience.
            You can convert your WETH back to ether at any time. You can read more about WETH here.

            question="Is AMP fully decentralized ?"
            match={match}
          >
            AMP is a hybrid decentralized exchange. We maintain the orderbook and match orders with each other. Trades are then settled on the Ethereum chain.
            This model allows up to provide a good user experience along with the benefits of centralized exchanges.

            match={match}
          >
            Owner of Proof tokens are rewarded with a portion of the trading fees (and in the future, other Proofsuite decentralized products) proportional to 
            the amount of Proof tokens they own. To reclaim your trading fees, you need to make a transaction to the rewards contract which will be published 
            soon. Proofsuite currently owns 90% of the Proof tokens and thus receives a large part of the trading fees that is 
            mostly used for paying the Exchange gas fees.

            question="What is the 'Unlocked' column section on the wallet page? Why do i need to unlock tokens ?"
            match={match}
          >
            Unlocking tokens allows the Proof smart contracts to make full use of the Ethereum blockchain capacities and provide a better user experience by for example letting your 
            trade from your wallet. In order to trade a token pair, you must unlock both tokens for that token pair. For example, if you are trading the MKR/USDC pair you will need to unlock
            trading for both the MKR token and the USDC token.

            match={match}
          >
            No. Contrary to most decentralized exchanges, making and canceling orders on the Proof decentralized exchange is free. You only pay the trade fee
            if the order is successfully settled on the Ethereum chain.

            The AMP matching-engine matches orders fast. When your order is matched, the corresponding trade is sent to a queue that will settle the trade
            on the Ethereum chain as soon as possible. You will thus receive several messages: 
            <FaqList>
              <FaqListItem>1) An order matched message: Your order was successfully filled or partially filled and the corresponding transaction is waiting to be sent to the Ethereum chain.</FaqListItem> <br/>
              <FaqListItem>2) An order pending message: The transaction has been sent to the Ethereum chain and is currently pending. You can follow the transaction with the given Etherscan link.</FaqListItem><br/>
              <FaqListItem>3) An order success message: Your order was confirmed and settled on the Ethereum chain and you have receive your tokens</FaqListItem><br/>

            question="How does AMP secure my funds ?"
            match={match}
          >
            Here are some facts about AMP security: 
            <FaqList>
              <FaqListItem>• We do not hold any of your Ether or tokens. They are all stored in your wallet on the Ethereum network and you can access them at anytime through any Ethereum client (think GUI) such as MyEtherWallet or Metamask. </FaqListItem>
              <FaqListItem>• The most secure way to trade on AMP is to use the Metamask wallet </FaqListItem>
              <FaqListItem>• If you choose log in without metamask, your secret key will be stored in the browser session storage and is deleted immediately at the end of the session (or also upon page refresh) </FaqListItem>
              <FaqListItem>• We do not have access to your private key. If you choose to do so, the only thing that will be stored after you leave the AMP website is your encrypted 
              Ethereum wallet if you choose to log in with your own wallet file, create your own wallet. You can delete the encrypted wallet from the browser storage at 
              anytime by deleting the corresponding address on the settings page. </FaqListItem>
              <FaqListItem>• All AMP source code can be read at https://github.com/Proofsuite </FaqListItem>

            In case your wallet was stored in the browser storage, you can access it by using the "Saved wallet" login method after clicking "Wallet" on the login page.
            Otherwise, unfortunately, there's nothing we can do to help you.

          >
            A limit order is an order placed to sell or buy a certain amount of tokens at a certain price or better. A limit order is not a market order, and thus may not 
            be executed if the price you've set cannot be met. The order will stay in the orderbook until it is completely filled or canceled.
